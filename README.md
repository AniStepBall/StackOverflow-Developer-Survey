# StackOverflow developer survey analysis
## Project Overview
This project analyzes a developer survey dataset from StackOverflow to understand the strategies used between developers, see current trends of technology, analyse the different way problem solving stategies by develeopers finally, what influences certain career decisions.

## Motivation
To understand the scope of 2020 by answering these questions:
1. Were there any patterns used by developer when collaborating with each other?
2. What were the trends for new technologies during 2020?
3. How does developer change their way of problem-solving patterns?
4. In what way does companies influence developer careers?

## Libraries Used
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* seaborn

## Repository Structure
* tech-overview.ipynb: Comprehensive Jupyter Notebook
* requirements.txt: Python environment dependencies
* stack-overflow-developer-survey-2020: A zip file that contains the dataset used. Here instead of the csv file because of size problems
* survey_results_public.csv: A 2020 developer survey from StackOverflow

- There is a consistent level across all career stages.
- The higher experince of the developers, the higher their technology usage

2. What were the trends for new technologies during 2020?
- The best indicator in 2020 was the year of experience
- The technology used in 2020 could influence future choices

3. How does developer change their way of problem-solving patterns?
- Developer will change their technolgy based on thier situation
- The higher their expereinces, the more they, code which lead to better problem-solving skills

4. In what way does companies influence developer careers?
- Companies size affects the impacts on developers
- The choices of technology is based on the companies size and needs
